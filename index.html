            <h1> about school </h1>
            <p>Established in 1965, Guru Harkrishan Public School India Gate, has always strived to impart Value Based Education
                maintaining the equilibrium between academics and cocurricular activities. We endeavor to navigate through the perilous path of modern day education without ignoring our rich culture. Our curriculum aims at providing space to children to recognize their innate potential and realize the vision of excellence in every venture. The primary purpose of education at GHPS India Gate is not to teach how to earn bread but how to make living worthwhile and meaningful. The aim of education should be to teach rather how to think, than what to think - rather to improve our minds, so as to enable us to think for ourselves, than to load the memory with thoughts of other men. The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows. The goal calls for better and more possibilities to support young children, and their families and communities, in all the areas where the child is growing physically, emotionally, socially and intellectually.</p>
